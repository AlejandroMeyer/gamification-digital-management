# IT Governance: The Directors' Cut 🎓🎮

**A Gamified Learning Experience for Digital Management | Topic 01**

## 📖 Project Overview
*IT Governance: The Directors' Cut* is a browser-based simulation game designed as the final project for the **Digital Management** Master's course. The game challenges players to navigate the complex landscape of IT Governance, Compliance, and Risk Management.

Players assume the role of an IT Leader (from Junior Analyst to Director) and must race against "automated" corporate threats—External Audit, Cyber Threats, and Legacy Systems—by answering curriculum-based questions correctly and managing system stability in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Progressive Difficulty:** Four role-based levels (Junior Analyst to Prof. Dr. MDBM Director).
* **Active Mechanics:** A hybrid of quiz-based progression and reflex-based "Orb" interaction (Patches vs. Malware).
* **Dynamic Content:** Questions are randomized and drawn directly from the "Digital Management" course syllabus (COBIT, ITIL, Design Thinking, Digital Economics).
* **System Integrity System:** "Hearts" represent system health; wrong answers or malware hits reduce integrity.
* **Automated Reporting:** Upon victory, the system generates a downloadable **PDF Director's Report** detailing session metrics.

## 🤖 Development Methodology: Prompt Engineering
This project is a case study in **AI-Assisted Development**.
* **Core Engineering:** The game architecture, logic, and styling were generated using advanced **Prompt Engineering techniques**.
* **Minimal Human Intervention:** Human coding was strictly limited to specific use-case refinements and content injection. The bulk of the logic, CSS animations, and state management was synthesized via AI prompts.
* **Content Source:** All quiz questions and logic scenarios were extracted and synthesized from official course lecture notes and uploaded PDF materials to ensure academic accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
To ensure maximum portability and ease of deployment on **GitHub Pages**, this project was intentionally architected as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** contained within a single `index.html` file.

While traditional development separates HTML, CSS, and JS into distinct directories, consolidating them here ensures:
1.  **Zero-Dependency Deployment:** No build steps (Webpack/Vite) required.
2.  **Static Stability:** The game runs immediately in any modern browser without server-side configuration.

## 🕹️ How to Run
1.  Download the `index.html` file.
2.  Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
3.  Ensure your audio is on for the full experience.

## 📚 Topics Covered
* **IT Governance Frameworks:** COBIT 2019, ITIL.
* **Digital Economics:** Abundance, Attention, and Platform Economies.
* **Innovation:** Design Thinking, Open Innovation, Scrum/Agile.
* **Compliance:** GDPR, ISO Standards, Risk Management.
